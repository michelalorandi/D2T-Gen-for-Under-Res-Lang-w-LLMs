Bana na nAmhain is a BBC television series starring Bill Oddie as the eponymous hero. It ran for three series between 1986 and 1989, and was revived for one series in 2009. It was created by Steve Bright, who also wrote the scripts and directed most episodes. The first series was produced by the BBC, but subsequent series were made by the company of the same name. Bana na nAmhain was a big success in Ireland, and was one of the most popular television series in the country for its entire run. It was the most watched programme on Irish television in 1989, and was the first programme to be broadcast in the new Irish television channel, TV3. It is now regarded as one of the most important television programmes in the history of Irish television. The show follows the adventures of Bananaman, a superhero who fights evil and injustice, with the aid of his trusty sidekick, Banana Girl. The show is set in a fictional version of the town of Bananamore, in County Mayo. The town is populated with a number of bizarre characters, including the Mayor, the local priest, and the town's cricket team, the Bananamanites. Bana na nAmhain is a spin-off of another BBC television series, The Banana Splits, which was produced in the United States. The two shows are unrelated, however, as Bana na nAmhain is set in the fictional town of Bananamore, which is not mentioned in The Banana Splits. Bana na nAmhain was created by Steve Bright, who also wrote and directed the show. The series was produced by Bright's own company, Bananaman Productions.

The Stavropolis, discovered on 11 June 1929, is a minor planet orbiting the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.2 AU once every 20378.5 years (1249.6 days; semi-major axis of 3.05 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation in 1929, or 5 years prior to its official discovery observation.  The Stavropolis (official designation: 1147 Stavropolis) is a large, bright object in the outer main-belt, about 3.1 AU from the Sun. It was discovered on 11 June 1929 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, who also discovered the asteroid 1408 Portevin. It is named after Stavropol Krai, the administrative center of which is the city of Stavropol.  The asteroid has a rotation period of 20378.5 hours, which corresponds to approximately 6.5 days, and an albedo between 0.52 and 0.56. As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of the asteroid has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.  As of 2018, the Stavropolis is classified as a member of the Phocaea family (701), a large group of stony asteroids and the largest group of the outer main-belt's background population. The family's defining characteristic is a distinct lack of near-Earth asteroids and Mars-crossers.  Diameter and albedo estimates range between 250 and 500 kilometers and 0.52 and 0.56, respectively, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.8.  As of 2018, no asteroid has been named after the city of Stavropol, which is also known by its older name Tsaritsyn.

The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in 1964 in New York City. It was one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s.[1] The Velvet Underground was composed of Lou Reed (lead vocals, guitar, and songwriter), John Cale (keyboards, viola, and vocals), Sterling Morrison (guitar, and vocals), and Moe Tucker (drums, percussion, and vocals).[2][3] They were associated with Andy Warhol's art group, The Factory, and the avant-garde art movement known as the New York School. The band's sound is rooted in the blues, but the band's music is also characterized by a minimalist approach to songwriting and an experimental use of studio techniques, which included tape loops, feedback, and backwards guitar.[4] In addition to their musical output, the band's minimalist aesthetic and anti-establishment attitudes influenced a number of musicians, including Sonic Youth, Nirvana, and My Bloody Valentine.[5] The Velvet Underground released three studio albums, The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), White Light/White Heat (1968), and Loaded (1970), which are regarded as classics of the rock era. The band disbanded in 1970, although Reed and Cale continued to work together as the short-lived band Loaded. Reed continued to record as a solo artist, while Cale formed the band theatrical rock group the Cale Composers in the 1970s. Morrison died in 1988. Tucker continued to work as a drummer for a number of artists. In 1998, Moe Tucker was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Velvet Underground. In 2003, the Velvet Underground was ranked number 76 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".[6] In April 2014, the Velvet Underground was ranked number 19 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".[7] The band's music was first released by the independent label Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable (EPi). In 1966, Warhol sold the band's contract to the Verve Records label. The band's first album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, was released in 1967. The album was recorded by the band with singer Nico, who left the

The Quine Tapes is a bootleg series of The Velvet Underground's first two albums Squeeze and White Light/White Heat. The series was released in 1984 by Polydor Records, with the first two volumes of the series titled The Quine Tapes and The Quine Tapes Volume 2. The series was recorded by Lou Reed and John Cale during their first US tour of the band in 1972. The series was created by Reed's then wife Maureen Tucker, who was frustrated by the band's lack of touring. Tucker had recorded the shows on her portable cassette recorder. Reed said in a 2012 interview with the BBC: The Quine Tapes were recorded in New York City in the summer of 1972. Lou and John were on the road and I had a portable cassette player. I was always trying to record their shows and I got a few. I think I had them all in my apartment. I think I sent them to John and Lou. I think Lou had them for a while and then he threw them out. I don't know what happened to them. John has a few of them, I think." The first volume of The Quine Tapes was released by Polydor Records in 1984. The first volume featured the tracks from the band's first two albums Squeeze and White Light/White Heat, as well as four unreleased tracks, two of which were from the Squeeze album and the other two from the White Light/White Heat album. The second volume of The Quine Tapes was released in 1986, and featured the remaining unreleased tracks from the Squeeze and White Light/White Heat albums. The Quine Tapes series was never officially released in the United Kingdom. In 2012, the band released a deluxe edition of The Velvet Underground and Nico which included the first volume of The Quine Tapes.

An ALCO RS-3 was a class of locomotive used by the Great Western Railway (GWR) and its successors, the British Railways (BR) and the current Network Rail. It was built by American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in the United States of America, and delivered to the GWR in May 1950 - August 1956.  The RS-3 was designed to operate on the GWR's West Country main line between London Paddington and Exeter, and on its branch lines to Bath, Bristol, Plymouth and Yeovil. The RS-3s were the first GWR locomotives to have their main frames constructed from welded steel, and they were the first to have their tenders built with internal cabs. The RS-3s were the first GWR locomotives to have air-operated brake cylinders, and were the last to be fitted with main steam pipes and valves.  The RS-3 was powered by a four-stroke engine, which developed 800 bhp at 2300 rpm. The RS-3 was constructed to a length of 17068.8 (millimetres), and was fitted with a tender with a water capacity of 3,200 imperial gallons (17,400 litres).  ALCO RS-3 locomotives were renumbered by the BR in 1951, and were finally withdrawn from service in June 1967.

The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in 1964 in New York City. It was one of the most influential and important groups of the 1960s counterculture and alternative music scene. The band was formed in 1964 by Lou Reed and John Cale, who were later joined by Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker. The band's original lineup lasted until 1970, when Tucker left to become a mother, and Reed and Morrison disbanded the group to pursue their own projects. Reed formed a new band, Transformer, with Tucker and Doug Yule, while Cale and Morrison formed The Modern Lovers. The Velvet Underground's self-titled debut album was released in 1967 to critical acclaim. It was an important influence on the development of punk rock and new wave music in the late 1970s. The Velvet Underground's songs were mostly written by Reed, and their distinctive sound was characterized by Reed's experimental songwriting and Cale's experimental and classical-inspired music. Their second album, White Light/White Heat, was released in 1968. Their final album, the 1970 live Loaded, was released after the group's disbandment, and it was a commercial success. The Velvet Underground's career was cut short by Reed's drug problems and a lack of commercial success. The band's early recordings were reissued in the 1990s as part of the bootleg series, which has become a popular genre of music collecting. Their debut album was ranked number 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and their song "All Tomorrow's Parties" was ranked number 36 on the magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. In 2003, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2009, Rolling Stone placed them at number 25 on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". The Velvet Underground was formed by John Cale, Lou Reed, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker. Their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, was released in 1967, and it was an underground hit. Their second album, White Light/White Heat, was released in 1968, and it featured the song "All Tomorrow's Parties", which was written by Reed. The Velvet Underground disbanded in 1970. Their third album, the live album Loaded, was released in 1970. Reed and Morrison formed new bands, while

Sludge metal is an American rock subgenre, with heavy metal and sludge metal elements. The earliest known bands were the Melvins and Neurosis in the early 1980s. Sludge metal has also been called Stoner metal, Doom metal, and Sludge-doom metal. In the early 1990s, bands like Eyehategod, Crowbar, Down, and Corrosion of Conformity began to emerge. These bands were influenced by the Melvins, Neurosis, and other early doom metal bands. Many of these bands came from the same area of the United States, with the scene centered in the Mississippi and Louisiana area. Many of these bands are also considered to be from the Southern metal genre. The term "sludge metal" was first used by Scott Reeder of the Melvins to describe the music of Eyehategod and other bands in the early 1990s. The term gained popularity in the mid 1990s. Other bands of the early 1990s include High on Fire, Down, Crowbar, Eyehategod, Corrosion of Conformity, Sleep, and Baroness. In the early 2000s, sludge metal gained a wider audience, with bands like Isis, Mastodon, Baroness, and High on Fire becoming more popular. Later, bands like Baroness, Kylesa, and Sleep began to gain a wider audience, and the genre began to be considered as a commercial success. In the 2010s, sludge metal bands such as Baroness, Kylesa, High on Fire, and Sleep have continued to gain popularity, and the genre has been considered to be one of the most popular subgenres of metal. Other popular bands include Eyehategod, Crowbar, Down, Corrosion of Conformity, and High on Fire.

An ALCORS-3 built for the London and North Eastern Railway in 1952 is preserved at the Severn Valley Railway.  The ALCO RS-3 was a 4-6-0 steam locomotive built by American Locomotive Company in the United States for the London and North Eastern Railway in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was one of the last steam locomotives to be built for the LNER.  The locomotive was of the B9 design, and was a development of the ALCO RS-2. The first RS-3s were built to the B9.1 specification, and were the most powerful steam locomotives built for the LNER. The last RS-3s built were the B9.3, which had a more powerful boiler and larger superheater surface.  The RS-3 was one of the most successful LNER locomotives, and was used extensively on the main lines and on the branch lines of the LNER network. Many were modified to RS-3A specification, which included an additional superheater surface, and were used on the branch lines. These locomotives were often given the name of the branch line they served, such as the "East Coast Express", which served the East Coast Main Line.  The RS-3 was also exported to the Southern Railway, where it was used on the main lines and branch lines. One example was the "Stockport Express", which ran between London and Manchester.  The RS-3 was superseded by the BR Standard Class 03 diesel-hydraulic locomotives, and the last steam locomotive to be built for the LNER was withdrawn in 1960.  The RS-3 is preserved at the Severn Valley Railway, and the East Coast Express is preserved at the National Railway Museum.

An ALCO RS-3 was a class of 1,700-ton, 17068.8-millimetre (6 ft 8 3⁄8 in × 5 ft 3 1⁄2 in) long, side-loading coal hopper car built by the American Locomotive Company in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The car had a short-lived career, being replaced in service by the ALCO RS-4, a larger version of the same design. The RS-3 was designed to haul large quantities of coal from mines in the West to fuel the emerging steel mills of the East. Although the design was intended to be simple, it proved to be difficult to build and maintain. The RS-3 was the first car built by ALCO to use the vertical, two-piece coal hopper that would later be used on many other ALCO designs. The RS-3 was also the first car to be produced with a welded construction, and the first to use the modern steam generator boiler. The RS-3 was used in the Illinois Central Railroad, which was later merged into the Illinois Central System. In the 1950s, the ICS was the largest coal-hauling railroad in the United States, and it was the only railroad in the country to use the RS-3.  The ICS RS-3 was used until the early 1960s, when it was replaced by the larger, more modern ALCO RS-4, which was essentially an RS-3 with a longer body and an additional pair of coal hoppers. The RS-3s were the last of the steam locomotives used by the ICS, which was fully converted to diesel power in the 1960s. The RS-3 was a heavy, lumbering locomotive, and was nicknamed the "Iron Horse". The RS-3 was also the last ALCO design to use the vertical, two-piece coal hopper, which would later be used on many other ALCO designs.

An ALCO RS-3 was a class of 4-6-2 locomotive built by the American Locomotive Company for the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP). The class was designed to meet a requirement from SP to replace the aging Baldwin 4-6-2 Pacifics that had been in service since the early 1900s. The new class was to be capable of hauling the SP's heaviest freight trains, and to be more powerful than the Baldwin units. ALCO built a total of 1418 RS-3s, which were built in two main groups. The first group, consisting of 1013 locomotives, was built between 1950 and 1956. These locomotives were the last ALCOs built with side frames and a center buffer. The second group, consisting of 905 locomotives, was built between 1964 and 1970. These units had a modified design with the center buffer removed and replaced with a centerplate and a buffer beam, and the cab moved forward to accommodate the larger centerplate. The second group had a number of other minor differences from the first group, such as a different type of air cleaner, a different type of smokebox, and different valve gear. Both groups were built with the same wheel arrangement, consisting of 24 x 2.25 ft (0.7 m) driving wheels and 48 x 1.25 ft (0.4 m) trailing wheels. The RS-3s were also the last ALCO locomotives to use a mechanical regulator for controlling the steam pressure in the boiler. They were succeeded by the ALCO RS-4, which was built with a more modern cab design.  The RS-3 was the first ALCO locomotive to use a cab with a modern "glass dome". It also had a new type of cab heater, which was more effective at removing moisture from the cab, and a cab air conditioner. The RS-3 was the first ALCO locomotive to use a mechanical regulator to control the boiler pressure. The RS-3 was also the first ALCO locomotive to use a cab-mounted air horn. The RS-3 was built with a number of different types of tenders, including tenders with a coal capacity of 50 long tons (51 t; 54 short tons), 100 long tons (101 t; 110 short tons), or 150 long tons (160 t; 170 short tons). The RS-3 was also the first ALCO locomotive to use a steam radiator. The RS-3 was the last ALCO

An Phoblacht/The Irish News Reporter: John McCormick Mexico’s leader of the Senate, Roberto Gil Zuarth, has been arrested in Mexico City on suspicion of money laundering. The arrest of the former justice minister, who was in charge of the country’s anti-corruption commission, is one of the biggest political scandals in Mexico in years. Mr Gil Zuarth, a close ally of President Enrique Pena Nieto, was arrested along with his wife, Laura Vargas, and a former member of the National Assembly, Jorge Luis Lavalle. Mr Gil Zuarth, who is a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), resigned as justice minister in September 2014. He was replaced by attorney general Jesus Murillo Karam. The three suspects are accused of receiving millions of dollars from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, which is facing corruption allegations in Latin America. The arrests are the first of several expected as Mexican authorities investigate the Odebrecht case. Mexico’s anti-corruption commission, headed by Mr Gil Zuarth, has been suspended as a result of the arrests. Mr Gil Zuarth, a lawyer and politician, is the second son of former president Luis Echeverria Alvarez. He was a close ally of Mr Pena Nieto, who was president until November 2012. The two men served together in the PRI, which has ruled Mexico since 1929. Mr Gil Zuarth was a justice minister from December 2012 to September 2014. He was replaced by attorney general Jesus Murillo Karam, who has been in charge of the Odebrecht investigation. Mr Gil Zuarth was president of the PRI in 2012, when Mr Pena Nieto became president. Mr Pena Nieto has not commented on the arrests. Mr Gil Zuarth has denied wrongdoing. Mr Gil Zuarth, 55, is married to Laura Vargas, who is the daughter of former president Miguel de la Madrid. He has two daughters. Mr Gil Zuarth was a justice minister in Mexico from December 2012 to September 2014.

An Phoblacht, the official newspaper of the Republican Sinn Féin party, carried the first edition of the Republican Proclamation on Easter Monday, 1916. It was signed by Eamon de Valera, Seán Mac Diarmada and Arthur Griffith. The Proclamation was a call for a Republic to be established in Ireland, and it contained the following: “We proclaim to the Irish nation that the Irish Republic is an accomplished fact, and that its sovereignty is based upon the will of the Irish people.” The Proclamation was published on the morning of Easter Monday, 1916. The Provisional Government, established by the Republican leaders, had been in place since the previous November. In the first few weeks of its existence, the Provisional Government was based in Dublin Castle. It was made up of republicans, nationalists and socialists, including some members of the Irish Volunteers. The Provisional Government was ousted by the British in May 1916, and the leadership of the Irish Republic was moved to the Curragh Camp, a training camp for the Irish Volunteers. In June 1916, the Provisional Government moved to the Mansion House in Dublin, where it remained until the end of the War of Independence in 1923. The Irish Republic was proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916, but the war of independence did not end until August 1921, when the Treaty of 1921 was signed.

The Quine Tapes is a bootleg series of The Velvet Underground's first two albums Squeeze (1967) and White Light/White Heat (1968). The series was released by Polydor Records and recorded in San Francisco.  Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes is a compilation of live recordings of The Velvet Underground that were recorded during their first two US tours and released in the UK by Polydor Records in 1975. The album is noteworthy for its inclusion of a number of previously unreleased performances, including early versions of several songs from The Velvet Underground & Nico, as well as the live debut of the Velvets' song "Sunday Morning".  The album's title refers to the name of the tape recorder used to record the performances. In a 2007 interview, the band's original guitarist Sterling Morrison explained that the name was a reference to the large number of times the tape recorder would break down during the band's performances.  Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes was released in the UK in 1975 by Polydor Records and distributed by WEA Records. The album was reissued in the US in 1992 by Rhino Records. In 2004, the album was reissued on CD by Rhino Records with the addition of five previously unreleased tracks.

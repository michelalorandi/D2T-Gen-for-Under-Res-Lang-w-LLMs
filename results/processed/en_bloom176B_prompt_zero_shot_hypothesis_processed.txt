The Stavropolis asteroid was discovered on October 1, 2014 by the Catalina Sky Survey. It has a diameter of about 9.5 kilometers and an estimated mass of about 3.9 million tons. Stavropolis is a member of the Koronis family and orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.6 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,637 days; semi-major axis of 3.04 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 14° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Palomar.  The asteroid was named for the Stavropol Region in Russia. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (H 127).  Stavropolis was initially designated as 2014 WY93, and later as 2015 FC, before being renamed to its present name.  In July 2016, Stavropolis reached its perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) at a distance of 0.25 AU, which is about 42.5 million kilometers. This occurred on 31 July 2016 (JD 2457600.5), when the asteroid was at a brightness of magnitude 17.8.  On 20 September 2016, Stavropolis will pass within 0.0024 AU (about 8.7 million kilometers) of Mars. The two objects will have their closest approach at 12:28 UTC. Stavropolis will be 0.09 magnitude fainter than Mars, and about 0.02 magnitude fainter than the brightest stars in the night sky. Stavropolis will be the brightest minor planet to pass so close to Mars since the flyby of asteroid (1685) Lépida on 28 July 2005.  A small lunar occultation of Stavropolis will occur on 25 October 2016, when the asteroid will pass between the Earth and the Moon. The occultation will begin at approximately 23:22 UTC, and will last for about 3.2 minutes.  Stavropolis will be at its brightest in early March 2017, when it will reach an apparent magnitude of about 14.7. It will also be at its closest to Earth on that date, at a distance of 0.084 AU (about 12.2 million kilometers).  The Stavropolis asteroid will pass 0.01 AU (about 14.6 million kilometers

The Fellowship of the Ring is a 1954 fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It is the first volume in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and was followed by The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The novel is set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, Tolkien's imagined past. It is written in a subgenre of fantasy known as high fantasy. It is also set in a secondary world that is in many ways a historical reconstruction of medieval Europe, with characters such as King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and the Holy Grail. The story concerns the journey of a group of friends called the Fellowship of the Ring, led by the hobbit Frodo Baggins, who must destroy a powerful ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron. This is the only way to prevent the re-emergence of Sauron and the return of the Dark Lord. The Fellowship of the Ring was published in the United Kingdom on 21 September 1954, and in the United States on 22 November 1954. It was preceded by The Hobbit, which was published in 1937. The book was the first of Tolkien's writings to be published in the United States, after a friend of his had sent a copy to the editor of Harper & Brothers, who agreed to publish it. It is considered to be one of the most important works of fantasy of the twentieth century. It has been translated into over 50 languages. Tolkien intended to publish the book under his own name, but Harper & Brothers insisted that he use a pseudonym, so he chose J. R. R. Tolkien, which stood for his initials, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien. Tolkien later explained that he chose the pseudonym because he had been called "Roy" by his friends and family, and he wanted to be addressed as "Reuel". The Fellowship of the Ring was a commercial success. It won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1955, and was nominated for the Carnegie Medal the same year. In 2001, it was listed by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, it was listed as the third best-selling book of the 20th century in the United States, with over 10 million copies sold. The novel was adapted into a film trilogy in the 1980s and 1990s.

Olga Nikolaevna Bondareva (born 30 August 1934 in Leningrad, Russia) is a Soviet mathematician. She is known for her contributions to algebraic geometry, including the proof of the Mordell–Weil theorem for elliptic curves, and for the proof of the existence of global holomorphic solutions of the Korteweg–de Vries equation. She is the author of several books and monographs on algebraic geometry. She is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 2012, she became a member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Bondareva was born in Leningrad. She graduated from Leningrad State University in 1958 with a degree in mathematics. She continued her education in Moscow, at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, from which she received a Ph.D. degree in 1965. She was awarded a Doctor of Sciences degree in 1973. She was a professor at the Steklov Institute from 1965 to 1986, when she became a professor at the Department of Mathematics of the Leningrad State University. She was elected as a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1983, and as a full member in 1990. Bondareva is best known for the proof of the Mordell–Weil theorem for elliptic curves (with Vladimir Popov), and for the proof of the existence of global holomorphic solutions of the Korteweg–de Vries equation (with Igor Shafarevich). She also made important contributions to algebraic geometry and the theory of algebraic curves. In addition, she worked on the theory of algebraic functions of one variable and on the theory of automorphic functions. In her book on the Mordell–Weil theorem, she introduced the notion of a canonical subgroup of an abelian variety. In her book on algebraic curves, she defined a canonical divisor on an algebraic curve, which she called the "canonical class". She also introduced the notions of a "canonical" map and of a "canonical" covering. She proved that a canonical map is birational, and that it is defined by a canonical covering. In a paper from 1968, she proved that any plane algebraic curve of degree at least 3 has infinitely many points of inflection. She also introduced the notion of an inflectional cover in her work on the Mordell–Weil theorem. She proved that any elliptic curve can be realized as an inflectional cover of a curve of genus 1. She also

The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in 1964 in New York City. It was one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s.[1] The band was active for three years, releasing two albums, before splitting up in 1967. In the early 1990s the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the band's albums were re-released and re-evaluated in the light of their importance to rock music. The band's original line-up was Lou Reed on lead vocals and guitar, John Cale on keyboards and viola, Sterling Morrison on bass guitar, and Maureen Tucker on drums and percussion. Reed and Cale had met in New York City in the early 1960s, and they began performing together in 1963. Reed had been a member of the New York Dolls, and Cale had been a member of The Modern Lovers. Morrison and Tucker were recruited by Reed and Cale in 1964. The band's first album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, was released in March 1967. The album was commercially unsuccessful, but it has since been widely regarded as a classic and has sold millions of copies. The band's second album, White Light/White Heat, was released in August 1967. The band's third album, The Velvet Underground, was released in February 1969, but the band was in disarray by then, with Reed and Morrison leaving the band and being replaced by Doug Yule and Angus Maclise respectively. Reed's first solo album, Transformer, was released in June 1972. The Velvet Underground played their last show in New York City on February 9, 1970, and then disbanded. Reed and Cale later reformed the band in the late 1970s, releasing a series of albums, and continuing to perform. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. The band is now considered a classic rock band.[2] The band's music, often classified as proto-punk, was influenced by the writings of William S. Burroughs, and by the music of artists such as Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, and Thelonious Monk.[3][4] The band's music was also influenced by the sounds of the New York City underground music scene, which was dominated by the blues, R&B, and jazz. The Velvet Underground's first album, The Velvet Underground & Nico,

Their album Year of No Light was released on March 18, 2014, and is the first album released by Crucial Blast.  I have a few questions:  Is this a correct translation of the triples? Does the translation of the first triple mean that Year of No Light is an album of the genre post-metal? Or that the album is by a band called Year of No Light of the genre post-metal? Is it correct to use the word genre as a noun here? Or should I use the word musical genre instead? What is the difference between recordLabel and label? In the first triple I used recordLabel but in the second I used label. What is the difference between Crucial Blast and CrucialBlast? I was told by a friend that the underscore is not correct here. Is that true?

Olga Nikolaevna Bondareva (born 30 July 1934), a Russian mathematician, is known for her contributions to the theory of graph coloring and to the theory of finite groups.  Bondareva is the author of a number of fundamental results on the chromatic number of graphs. In 1968 she proved that every bridgeless cubic graph has chromatic number at most four. In 1974 she proved that the chromatic number of any bridgeless cubic graph is either four or five. In 1976 she proved that every bridgeless cubic graph is 4-colorable unless it is isomorphic to a double cover of the Petersen graph. In the same paper she conjectured that every bridgeless cubic graph is 4-colorable. This conjecture was proved by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in 1977. In a further paper in 1977, she proved that the graph of any bridgeless cubic graph is 4-colorable unless it is isomorphic to one of seven exceptional graphs. In 1978 she proved that every bridgeless cubic graph is 4-colorable unless it is isomorphic to one of three exceptional graphs. In 1982, she proved that every bridgeless cubic graph is 4-colorable unless it is isomorphic to one of five exceptional graphs. In 1997, she proved that every bridgeless cubic graph is 4-colorable unless it is isomorphic to one of five exceptional graphs.  Bondareva also made important contributions to the theory of finite groups. In 1973, together with A. Shapiro and V. Shapiro, she proved that if a finite group has a normal subgroup of index at most two, then it has a normal subgroup of index at most four. In 1979, she proved that if a finite group has a normal subgroup of index at most two, then it has a normal subgroup of index at most three. In 1980, together with A. Shapiro, she proved that if a finite group has a normal subgroup of index at most two, then it has a normal subgroup of index at most five. In 1984, together with A. Shapiro, she proved that if a finite group has a normal subgroup of index at most two, then it has a normal subgroup of index at most six.  Bondareva was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Soviet Union. She studied mathematics at the Leningrad State University, receiving a Ph.D. in 1964. She joined the Leningrad Mathematical Institute

The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in 1964 in New York City. It was composed of singer/songwriter Lou Reed, guitarist Sterling Morrison, drummer Maureen Tucker, and bassist John Cale, who was later replaced by Doug Yule. The band's name was taken from Andy Warhol's 1964 film, The Velvet Underground. Their music was heavily influenced by the blues, the avant-garde, and the art rock of the time. The band's debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, was released in March 1967. Although the album was critically acclaimed, it was not a commercial success. However, it was widely influential, and has been called the "first punk rock album." The Velvet Underground was one of the first bands to produce its own album artwork, including the iconic banana-shaped cover of their debut album. The band's recordings were notable for their experimental production and sound, which included the use of feedback and noise, and the absence of a traditional rhythm section. Reed's songwriting and lyrics were also notable for their unconventional style, which has been called "brooding, dark, and introspective." Reed's distinctive voice, characterized by a high-pitched timbre and a tendency to pronounce words as syllables, became a defining characteristic of the band. The band had several line-up changes throughout its existence. Reed and Morrison left the band in 1968, and were replaced by guitarist Angus MacLise and bassist Maureen Tucker. Tucker left the band in 1969, and was replaced by Doug Yule. The band recorded two more studio albums in 1969 and 1970, before disbanding. The Velvet Underground reunited in 1973 and recorded two more albums. The band broke up for a second time in 1974. In 1998, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The Velvet Underground was one of the most influential bands of the 1960s. Its music was highly influential on the development of punk rock, new wave, alternative rock, and heavy metal. It was also influential on the development of hip hop. The Velvet Underground's songs have been covered by numerous artists, including U2, Nirvana, the Pixies, and the Beastie Boys. Reed's songwriting style has been particularly influential, and his work has been cited as an influence by several artists, including David

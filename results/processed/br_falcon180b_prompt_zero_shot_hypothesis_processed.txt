Brandon Carter was born in London, England in 1942. He earned his BS from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1963 and his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1967. He was a student of Dennis Sciama. Carter has held positions at the University of Paris, the University of Durham, and the University of London. He is currently a professor at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics. He has worked on a wide range of topics in both particle physics and astrophysics, including grand unification, cosmic strings, the inflationary universe, and quantum gravity. In 1983, he and Rouven Essig considered the possibility that the left-right symmetric model could lead to a first order electroweak phase transition and a detectable number of magnetic monopoles. This idea has influenced many subsequent studies of particle physics and cosmology. In 1993, with D. B. Kaplan, he showed how the properties of cosmic strings could be used to test the nature of gravity. In 1994, he was awarded the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics by the American Institute of Physics.

Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a genre which drew heavily on the African-American genres of blues and R&B, and also incorporated country music. The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. In the 1970s, it spawned sub-genres such as soft rock, hard rock, heavy metal, glam rock, art rock, punk rock, new wave and alternative rock, among others.
